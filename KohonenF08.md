Goals and Motivation
====================

ATALIBF08 is a Fortran 2008 object-oriented library for geostatistical applications. The goal of this project is to provide a community-driven geostatistical library for Fortran using the modern capabilities offered by this programming language.


Scope
=====

The goal of the `ATALIBF08` Library is to achieve the following general scope:

* Data transformation (normal scores, Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)
* Declustering methods (moving window, cell, kriging, Multi-layer Self-Organizing Maps, ...)
* Experimental semivariogram estimation (traditional semivariogram, covariance, correlogram, general relative, pairwise relative, semimadogram ...)
* Spatial Estimation or Kriging (simple, ordinary, kriging with external drift, kriging with trend, kriging with boundary conditions, ...)
* Stochastic simulation (sequential simulation - Gaussian, Indicator, Direct, Multiple Point - ...)

Code of Conduct
===============

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
