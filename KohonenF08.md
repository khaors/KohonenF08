Goals and Motivation
====================

A Fortran 2008 library for Self-Organizing Maps using object-oriented programming and modern Fortran features.

Scope
=====

The goal of the `KohonenF08` Library is to achieve the following general scope:

* Data transformation (normal and uniform standarization)
* Clustering using Self-Organizing Maps with one a several layers
* Clustering using VISOM

Code of Conduct
===============

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
